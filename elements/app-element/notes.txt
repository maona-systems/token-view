    // AN APP IS A TREE OF HTML-ELEMENTS
    
    // ELEMENTS HAVE: METHODS, DATA, LIFECYCLE CALLBACKS, EVENT-LISTENERS, DOM

    // WHEN AN ELEMENT IS CREATED, THE LIFECYCLE CALLBACKS ARE EXECUTED, THEN IT WAITS FOR EVENTS

    // IN THE LIFECYCLE CALLBACKS THE ELEMENT RESOLVES ITS STATE AND THEN ITS DOM

    // THE DOM FOLLOWS THE STATE

    // ELEMENTS RESPOND TO EVENTS BY CHANGING THEIR STATE OR DOM OR DOING SOME OTHER OPERATION

    // EVENT > STATE > DOM

    // EVENT > DOM

    // SHADOW AFFECTS CSS REM UNITS

INCREASE THE HEIGHT

THEN
