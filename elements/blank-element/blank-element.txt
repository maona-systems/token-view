An HTML app is a tree of HTML elements

An element has the following aspects: function-attributes, data-attributes, lifecycle-callbacks, event-listeners, dom, cssom

When an element is created, its lifecycle callbacks are executed, then it waits for events

When a relevant event is dispatched, the event-listeners are executed

Elements respond to events by changing their state or dom or doing some other OPERATION

Events are triggered by user or browser or code

We also implement "smart variables" using getters and setters. Smart variables react when modified

When the state changes, the dom must be updated

We can change the dom via lifecycle callbacks, event-listeners and smart-variables
